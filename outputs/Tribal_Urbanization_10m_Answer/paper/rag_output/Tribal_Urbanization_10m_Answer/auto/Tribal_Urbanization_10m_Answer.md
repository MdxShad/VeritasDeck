# Impact of urbanization and industrialization on tribal communities of India. (10 Ma

Urbanization and industrialization have entered tribal India mainly through mines, dams, industries and expanding towns in resource■rich areas. As noted by scholars like Verrier Elwin and Virginius Xaxa, this “development” has brought both integration and dispossession.

Major impacts:

• Displacement and land alienation: Projects in Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh etc. uproot adivasis from ancestral forests, weakening customary rights and sacred ties with land.

• Livelihood change: Subsistence cultivation and MFP collection give way to casual wage work in construction, mines and cities; distress migration and urban slums increase.

• Socio■cultural stress: Breakdown of clan and village councils, erosion of language and rituals, rise of alcoholism and crime; youth face a conflict between tradition and modernity.

• Health and vulnerability: NFHS■5 still shows higher child mortality and under■nutrition among STs despite better physical access to services.

Way forward: Strict implementation of PESA, FRA, fair R&R, and schemes of MoTA can turn urban■industrial growth into dignified, culturally sensitive tribal development.
