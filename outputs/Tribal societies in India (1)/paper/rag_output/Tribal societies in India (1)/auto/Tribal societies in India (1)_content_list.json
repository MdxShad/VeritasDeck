The People’s Linguistic Survey of India (PLSI 2013) recorded 780 languages and 86 scripts, yet many of these are spoken by tiny populations and are not officially recognised. UNESCO’s Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger lists 197 Indian languages in various stages of endangerment: 81 vulnerable, 62 definitely endangered, 7 severely endangered, 42 critically endangered and 5 already extinct . Over the last five decades1 India has lost roughly 250 languages ; linguist G.N.   Devy warns that about 400 more could1 disappear in the near future $^ 2$ . The vast majority of endangered tongues are tribal. Because tribal communities form only about $8 . 6 \\%$ of India’s population, their languages are often invisible in national policies and census operations that only list languages spoken by more than 10 000 people . This3 note summarises the reasons why tribal languages are threatened, the consequences of their decline, government efforts to conserve them, and recommendations for revitalisation. ",
